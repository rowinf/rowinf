## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a long time web developer, lifelong learner, and a part time philosopher

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about JavaScript, TypeScript, Web Applications
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, SQL, Docker

A project I'm currently working on: [Phamily Photos](https://github.com/rowinf/phamily-photos) it is a photo album for families, written in Go.

A recent project I'm especially proud of is [ado-pr-dashboard](https://github.com/rowinf/ado-pr-dashboard). I was able to try out Bun's sqlite adapter and made a nice back end Typescript application for viewing pull request data for Azure DevOps. Bun and Sqlite is a nice and easy way to render some data on the browser. I even managed to get some htmx in there. The end product is a nice interactive data table that makes ajax requests with zero client-side JavaScript, except for the htmx library itself. It might be useful for keeping a developer team accountable so everyone does their fair share of code reviews.
